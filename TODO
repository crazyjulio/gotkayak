TODO, in no particular order

Things to do for V1.1 and beyond:

1. Maybe for the trips main picture, I could use a google map with marked launch and takeout spots.

2. Want to see if I can design a graphic where the twitter bird is paddling a kayak. For wherever I put the
 "Follow us on Twitter" bit

3. Create custom 404, 422 and 500 pages. Maybe 422 can be a picture of a kayak locked up. 500 can
be a sinking kayak (maybe not the best representation of the product). 404 can be a kayak on open
water with noone in it, with link back to home page.

4. Get better images for front page.

5. Maybe find a place on the home page to say things like "Malibu Boats will last
  longer and are higher quality than the box stores, etc., in addition to the fit"

6. HTTPClient gem not behaving for me. If I really care about nearest_water_gauge
  info and getting real time stats, then fix this.

7. I have some mixed content issues I need to sort for Font Awesome. This is not the case in
  staging. Maybe because staging is https. Production is http though, so I need to check it out in production.

8. See if I can justify the nav, similar to this:
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#btn-groups-justified

9. Add a home button to the nav.

10. Relocate map to be over pony pasture instead of Huguenot Woods


Fishing competition:
  1. Give users a chance to look at previous years.
  2. Would be a very nice feature to be able to export all a users fish images.
  3. Set up a feature via action cable to update the main page when someone adds a new fish.
    Or when someone adds a comment to a fish, or both.
  4. Set up web push notifications for fishing competitors to get notifications on their phone:
    https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-for-a-mobile-website-not-app-to-push-alerts-to-the-smartphone-like-an-app
    https://onesignal.com/
  5. Should I ever switch to mongo, use this to store data for fishing competition:
