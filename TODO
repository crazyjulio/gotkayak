TODO, in no particular order

Things to do for V1.1 and beyond:

1. Maybe for the trips main picture, I could use a google map with marked launch and takeout spots.

2. Want to see if I can design a graphic where the twitter bird is paddling a kayak. For wherever I put the
 "Follow us on Twitter" bit

3. Create custom 404, 422 and 500 pages. Maybe 422 can be a picture of a kayak locked up. 500 can
be a sinking kayak (maybe not the best representation of the product). 404 can be a kayak on open
water with noone in it, with link back to home page.

4. Use this to store data for fishing competition: https://mlab.com/plans/pricing/#plan-type=sandbox

5. Set up web push notifications for fishing competitors to get notifications on their phone:

6. HTTPClient gem not behaving for me. If I really care about nearest_water_gauge
  info and getting real time stats, then fix this.

7. I have some mixed content issues I need to sort for Font Awesome.
