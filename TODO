TODO, in no particular order

Things to do for V1.1 and beyond:

1. Maybe for the trips main picture, I could use a google map with marked launch and takeout spots.

2. Want to see if I can design a graphic where the twitter bird is paddling a kayak. For wherever I put the
 "Follow us on Twitter" bit

3. Create custom 404, 422 and 500 pages. Maybe 422 can be a picture of a kayak locked up. 500 can
be a sinking kayak (maybe not the best representation of the product). 404 can be a kayak on open
water with noone in it, with link back to home page.

4. HTTPClient gem not behaving for me. If I really care about nearest_water_gauge
  info and getting real time stats, then fix this.

5. I have some mixed content issues I need to sort for Font Awesome.

6. Navbar Collapse links should be left justified.

7. Should maybe add a form to capture user emails so Dad can notify those people when
  there are sales on kayaks, or new kayaks have come in. Gotta be careful about how
  I do it though, because I have limited rows in my database. Maybe use a service like Wufoo


Fishing competition:
  1. Give users a chance to look at previous years.
  2. Would be a very nice feature to be able to export all a users fish images.
  3. Set up a feature via action cable to update the main page when someone adds a new fish.
    Or when someone adds a comment to a fish, or both.
  4. Should I ever switch to mongo, use this to store data for fishing competition:
    https://mlab.com/plans/pricing/#plan-type=sandbox
  5. Maybe add a monthly task that updates everyone on the current status of the competition
  6. I might be able to put the OneSignal code into the body of the layout file to get it to
    load every time. Or maybe into the body of the index page and the profile/edit page.
