DEPLOYING

As of Feb. 2012, the app is on Heroku's Cedar stack. To deploy to heroku, issue the following command: `git push heroku master`
To run migrations, `heroku run rake db:migrate --app gotkayak-cedar`, then `heroku restart --app gotkayak-cedar`

DATA

Some data was pre-populated in the app in 2 ways. First through the seeds file. Second through yaml files in config/data
These were set up due to the fact that they are simple arrays and will rarely, if ever, change, and hence didn't
need scaffolding. Currently there are config files for product types and waterbody types.

To drop:
`heroku pg:reset SHARED_DATABASE --confirm gotkayak-cedar --app gotkayak-cedar`
To recreate:
`heroku run rake db:migrate --app gotkayak-cedar`
To seed the database:
`heroku run rake db:seed --app gotkayak-cedar`
Then restart the app.
